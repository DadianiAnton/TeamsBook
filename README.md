# TeamsBook

Hello!

This reppo was created for the book I'm working on. Actually I have no idea about it's title yet, but the main concept is to consider teams as social systems. This approach makes it possible to formulate formal criteria for testing groups for teamwork and to develop a model of team maturity. This model will help identify team dysfunctions and plan team scaling or transformation.

The book is being written in russian, but let me know if you are interested in translations.
