# TeamsBook

Hello!

This reppo was created for my book. Actually I have no idea about it's title yet, but the main idea main is to consider teams as social systems. This approach makes it possible to formulate formal criteria for testing groups for teamwork and to develop a model of team maturity. Based on this model, it will be possible to identify team dysfunctions and plan their scaling or transformation.

The book is being written in russian, but let me know if you are interested in translations.
